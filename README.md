# FlavorCraft üç≥‚ú®
*Smart Recipe Curation Platform - AI-Powered Multimodal Recipe Generator*

## Project Overview

FlavorCraft is an innovative culinary platform that leverages Google Gemini AI to transform your available ingredients, food images, and voice preferences into personalized, detailed recipes. By combining multiple input modalities (text, image, and audio), FlavorCraft creates a truly intelligent cooking assistant that understands not just what you have, but how you want to cook.

## üéØ Core Concept

### The Problem
- Traditional recipe apps require you to search for specific dishes
- Ingredient-based searches often yield generic results
- No consideration for cooking skill level, dietary preferences, or available equipment
- Limited personalization and contextual understanding

### The FlavorCraft Solution
FlavorCraft flips the script by being **ingredient-centric** and **preference-aware**:

1. **Tell us what you have** - List your available ingredients
2. **Show us your inspiration** - Upload photos of dishes you'd like to recreate
3. **Express your preferences** - Use voice commands to specify dietary needs, cooking style, or skill level
4. **Receive intelligent curation** - Get personalized recipes that match your exact situation

## üé® User Interface Theory

### Design Philosophy
- **Ingredient-First**: The interface prioritizes ingredient input as the starting point
- **Multimodal Harmony**: Seamlessly integrates text, image, and voice inputs
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Advanced options are available but don't clutter the main flow
- **Responsive Feedback**: Real-time updates and visual feedback for all actions

### User Journey
1. **Landing**: Clean, inviting interface with clear call-to-action
2. **Input Collection**: Multiple ways to provide information (text, image, voice)
3. **Processing**: Visual feedback during AI analysis
4. **Results**: Beautiful recipe display with actionable information
5. **Iteration**: Easy modification and re-generation capabilities

## üß† AI Integration Theory

### Prompt Engineering
FlavorCraft uses sophisticated prompt engineering to:
- Combine multiple input types into coherent recipe requests
- Maintain context across different input modalities
- Generate comprehensive recipes with proper formatting
- Include cooking tips and variations

### Multimodal Fusion
